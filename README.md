# Automated System Health Monitor

_Python script that monitors CPU/memory/disk usage_

## Project Journal

To begin this project I installed dependencies. I installed the process and system utilities library on VSCode. 

This is what I did in the VSCode terminal before coding my project...

**pip install psutil requests**

Next, I used my Python fundamentals and the libraries' documentation to create a Python file to be scripted.

After completing my initial code, I tested in the terminal to make sure that the program works correctly.

I typed this in to test the code: 

**python3 system_monitor.py**

Here are my results...
